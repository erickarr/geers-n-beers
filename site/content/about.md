## One Year Ago

We were just a group of coworkers who spoke casually of cycling. Over a handful of drinks, paired with light lunch conversation, we formulated a team to ride against MS! 

## Our Team Name

Derives from two simple ingredients. The first, being each of our backgrounds in engineering. The second and most important factor, our beverage (fuel) of choice.

## Our Goal

To fundraise for an awesome cause, and have fun while doing it! If you see us on the ride, give us a holler!
