## Our Third Year
A year has quickly come and gone, summer is coming to a close, and our team is *geering* up for our third consecutive year!

In the coming weeks, we look to complete a few training rides together, with post ride hydration training to follow.

## Thank You
Our team would like to extend our gratitude to those who have supported us in the past, and whom continue to support us as we move forward!

Due to your generosity, we were able to fundraise **$3,250** during the year of 2018 towards MS Research. Looking forward to what we can achieve in 2019!
